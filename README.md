# Official OPC UA .Net Standard Samples from the OPC Foundation

## Overview

Sample Servers and Clients, including all required controls, for .NET Framework 4.6.2, .NET Core 2.0 and UWP.

Integrates the offical OPC UA [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OPCFoundation.NetStandard.Opc.Ua/) package containing the OPC UA reference implementation targeting [.NET Standard](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/net-standard).

.Net Standard allows you develop apps that run on all common platforms available today, including Linux, iOS, Android (via Xamarin) and Windows 7/8/8.1/10 (including embedded/IoT editions) without requiring platform-specific modifications. 
Furthermore, cloud applications and services (such as ASP.Net, DNX, Azure Websites, Azure Webjobs, Azure Nano Server and Azure Service Fabric) are also supported.

## Getting Started
All the tools you need for .Net Standard come with the .Net Core tools. See [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/core/getting-started) for what you need.

<a name="certificates"/>

## Self signed certificates for the sample applications

All required application certificates for OPC UA are created at the first start of each application in a directory or OS-level certificate store and remain in use until deleted from the store.

### Windows .Net applications
By default the self signed certificates are stored in a **X509Store** called **CurrentUser\\UA_MachineDefault**. The certificates can be viewed or deleted with the Windows Certificate Management Console (certmgr.msc). The *trusted*, *issuer* and *rejected* stores remain in a folder called **OPC Foundation\CertificateStores** with a root folder which is specified by the `SpecialFolder` variable **%CommonApplicationData%**. On Windows 7/8/8.1/10 this is usually the invisible folder **C:\ProgramData**. 

Note: Since the sample applications in the UA-.Net repository use the same storage and application names as UA-.NetStandard, but create only certificates with hostname `localhost`, it is recommended to delete all existing certificates in **MachineDefault** to recreate proper certificates for all sample applications when moving to the UA-.NetStandard repository. 

### Windows UWP applications
By default the self signed certificates are stored in a **X509Store** called **CurrentUser\\UA_MachineDefault**. The certificates can be viewed or deleted with the Windows Certificate Management Console (certmgr.msc). 

The *trusted*, *issuer* and *rejected* stores remain in a folder called **OPC Foundation\CertificateStores** in the **LocalState** folder of the installed universal windows package. Deleting the application state also deletes the certificate stores.

### .Net Standard Console applications on Windows, Linux, iOS etc.
The self signed certificates are stored in a folder called **OPC Foundation/CertificateStores/MachineDefault** with a root folder which is specified by the `SpecialFolder` variable **%LocalApplicationData%** or in a **X509Store** called **CurrentUser\\My**, depending on the configuration. For best cross platform support the personal store **CurrentUser\\My** was chosen to support all platforms with the same configuration. Some platforms, like macOS, do not support arbitrary certificate stores.

The *trusted*, *issuer* and *rejected* stores remain in a shared folder called **OPC Foundation\CertificateStores** with a root folder specified by the `SpecialFolder` variable **%LocalApplicationData%**. Depending on the target platform, this folder maps to a hidden locations under the user home directory.

## Local Discovery Server
By default all sample applications are configured to register with a Local Discovery Server (LDS). A reference implementation of a LDS for Windows can be downloaded [here](https://opcfoundation.org/developer-tools/developer-kits-unified-architecture/local-discovery-server-lds). To setup trust with the LDS the certificates need to be exchanged or registration will fail.

## How to build and run the samples in Visual Studio on Windows

1. Open the UA Sample Applications.sln solution file using Visual Studio 2017.  
2. Choose a project in the Solution Explorer and set it with a right click as `Startup Project`.
3. Hit `F5` to build and execute the sample.

## How to build and run the console samples on Windows, Linux and iOS
This section describes how to run the **NetCoreConsoleClient** and **NetCoreConsoleServer** sample applications.

Please follow instructions in this [article](https://aka.ms/dotnetcoregs) to setup the dotnet command line environment for your platform. As of today .Net Standard 2.0 is required.

### Prerequisites
1. Once the `dotnet` command is available, navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the repository and execute `dotnet restore UA Sample Applications.sln`. This command calls into NuGet to restore the tree of dependencies.

### Start the server 
1. Open a command prompt. 
2. Navigate to the folder **Samples/NetCoreConsoleServer**. 
3. To run the server sample type `dotnet run --project NetCoreConsoleServer.csproj -a`. 
    - The server is now running and waiting for connections. 
    - The `-a` flag allows to auto accept unknown certificates and should only be used to simplify testing.

### Start the client 
1. Open a command prompt 
2. Navigate to the folder **Samples/NetCoreConsoleClient**. 
3. To run the sample type `dotnet run --project NetCoreConsoleClient.csproj -a` to connect to the OPC UA console sample server running on the same host. 
    - The `-a` flag allows to auto accept unknown certificates and should only be used to simplify testing. 
    - To connect to another OPC UA server specify the server as first argument and type e.g. `dotnet run --project NetCoreConsoleClient.csproj -a opc.tcp://myserver:51210/UA/SampleServer`. 
4. If not using the `-a` auto accept option, on first connection, or after certificates were renewed, the server may have refused the client certificate. Check the server and client folder **%LocalApplicationData%/OPC Foundation/CertificateStores/RejectedCertificates** for rejected certificates. To approve a certificate copy it to the **%LocalApplicationData%/OPC Foundation/CertificateStores/UA Applications** folder.
5. Retry step 3 to connect using a secure connection.

## How to build and run the OPC UA COM Server Wrapper
- Please refer to the OPC Foundation UA .Net Standard Library [COM Server Wrapper](ComIOP/README.md) for a detailed description how to run the OPC COM wrapper.

## How to build and run the OPC UA Aggregation Client and Server
- Please refer to the OPC Foundation UA .Net Standard Library [Aggregation Client and Server](Workshop/Aggregation/README.md) for a detailed description how to run the aggregation client and server.

## How to build and run the OPC UA Xamarin Client
- Please refer to the OPC UA [Xamarin Client](Samples/XamarinClient/readme.md) for a detailed description how to run the UA Xamarin Client on UWP, Android and iOS.

## What happened to the OPC UA Web Telemetry sample?
The web telemetry sample was removed as there is a much more complete (and better looking!) solution now available [here](https://github.com/azure/azure-iot-connected-factory). You can try this new solution, called "Connected Factory", out [here](http://www.azureiotsuite.com).
